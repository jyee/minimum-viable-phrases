# Minimum Viable Phrases

[Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) allow you to spend few resources to build a protype from which you can establish a baseline and iterate on. Minimum Viable Phrases has a similar aim: Just a little bit of language can help you establish a friendly interaction and you can "iterate" from there.


## Organization

Files here use the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) 2-letter code for naming.

Todo: figure out some logical way to subdivide languages for regional variation.

This repository needs your help! Please contribute a pull request to add phrases in another language or update an existing one.

This repository will eventually have some sort of open license, when someone with more knowledge and opinions on such matters submits it (via PR) and I merge it.
